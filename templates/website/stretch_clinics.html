                        towards physical goals, check technique and identify specific tasks to improve your
                        overall practice/performance. It can also be your space to look at more internal
                        issues such as stress management/promoting emotional well being. For many
                        people food and their relationship with it, this can be a safe space to look at
                        understanding nutrition or redefining your relationship with food. Your body and mind

                        Clinics are suitable for everyone. Some people use it as a way to start their
                        FlexiBeast journey, others as a way to top up what they learn in class. A variety of
                        issues can be assessed and addressed in a clinic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a particular flexibility goal we can assess where you are then work
                        towards your goal safely combining flexibility and strength work to increase range of
                        motion around a joint while keeping it stable. Each body is a unique puzzle to be
                        figured out and explored a clinic is space to do that <i>(Alicia loves a puzzle)</i>.

                    <p>
                        If you are recovering from injury we can work on bringing you back to full strength.
                        This would be done in conjunction with health professionals, your safety is key.

                        Alicia specialises in working with hypermobility and helping people to regain some
                        control and to help prevent injury now and degenerative problems in later life.
                        Hypermobility is a complex condition and Alicia will take a holistic approach in
                        helping you to manage and understand it.

                        Nutrition is often something people struggle to manage, particularly with the pace of
                        modern living. In a clinic you can look at getting the most from food and look at
                        understanding and improving your relationship with food. Unless you are looking to
                        check for an intolerance, Alicia will not be prescriptive in her approach.....this is
                        about a lifetime of wellness.</p>
                    <p>
                        Stress is something we juggle in modern living. It is expressed in a variety of ways
                        either physical or mental/emotional. Using a combination of Yoga and psychological
                        practices we can look at regaining balance and control. Alicia will work with you to
                        find which approach is most effective for you.
