                        A workshop is a slightly different environment to a class.
                        We are able to go into more depth and to slow things down so you can
                        work on technique and take things at a more steady pace because we have more
                        time (not to say you won't sweat).  The main feedback from people who have
                        come to workshops as well as classes is that they leave with a greater
                        understanding and well and truly stretched. </p>

                   Workshops will generally be 2-3 hours and numbers are strictly limited
                   at 9.  This is to ensure that I have time to get round people,
                   put hands on if needed (in the nicest way possible). </p>
